Your arrival to the town has created a real flurry, every one of the locals wanted to see you.
Some with impression, some with hopes of their fears disappearing once and for all. 
You have decided to stay in a small motel by the main road.
After unpacking all of your stuff, you decided to go to sleep, since the next day was supposed to be exhausting: looking for clues, speaking with witnesses etc.
Only if you would have known. 
Next day miraculously all of you woke up in a strange place. 
It was a small wooden hut consisting of 2 rooms, between which you were split in half.
